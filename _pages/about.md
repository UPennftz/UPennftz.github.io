[LinkedIn主页](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianzefei/)
I am a fast learner with a strong internal drive to maintain a habit of lifelong learning. The three areas in which I have foundational expertise are Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science. My passion for state-of-the-art technology transcends my specialization and drives me to explore various fields. Currently, my main interest is in the intersection of data analytics and fintech, and I am primarily self-taught in anti-money laundering and risk control.  

Academic Achievements

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
